Revision history for Perl extension Coro.

0.03  Fri Jul 13 14:51:52 CEST 2001
	- transfer() now implemented in XS (beware).
	- new module Coro::Cont for really faked continuations.
	- big internal architecture changes: Coro::State is now
          really low-level and can thus be used to implement other
          interesting things, While "Coro::" implements a process-like
          model. Still crude and subject to change.
        - $_ and $@ are no longer being localized.

        - $_ and $@ are now localized.
        - added Coro::Channel.
        - more testcases, still no docs.
