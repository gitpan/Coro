Revision history for Perl extension Coro.

0.07  Tue Jul 17 17:40:18 CEST 2001
	- release candidate 1 ;)
	- slightly nicer code.
        - fixed a scheduling bug in Coro::Event.

        - ok, I found the showstopper - the same sub must not be
          re-entered in two different coroutines, otherwise => crash. I
          see no easy solution to this problem, except by walking the call
          chaing and saving/restoring the cv's, which is what I do now.
        - memory leaks still latent, especially at thread termination.
        - Coro::Event now works (haha).

0.05  Sun Jul 15 17:32:20 CEST 2001
	- fixed a few issues in Coro::Event.
        - I forgot to include Coro::Event in 0.04 :(:(:(

0.04  Sun Jul 15 05:24:59 CEST 2001
	- @_ is now properly localized.
	- Coro::State is now easier subclassable.
        - Coro::Cont now coroutine-aware.
        - Coro::Specific is a low-overhead module to create
          coroutine-specific vars.
        - Coro::Event provides a simple interface to Event.

0.03  Fri Jul 13 14:51:52 CEST 2001
	- transfer() now implemented in XS (beware).
	- new module Coro::Cont for really faked continuations.
	- big internal architecture changes: Coro::State is now
          really low-level and can thus be used to implement other
          interesting things, While "Coro::" implements a process-like
          model. Still crude and subject to change.
        - $_ and $@ are no longer being localized.

0.02  Tue Jul 10 01:38:17 CEST 2001
	- implemented "async" attribute.
        - $_ and $@ are now localized.
        - added Coro::Channel.
        - more testcases, still no docs.

0.01  Tue Jul  3 02:18:41 CEST 2001
	- original version; copied from Convert::Scalar.
